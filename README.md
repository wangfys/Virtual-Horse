# Virtual Horse

This is the page for the project Virtual Horse. It is still an ongoing project for reducing traffic accidents so this page will be updated in the future.

## AutomotiveUI '21 Adjunct

We have conducted a pilot study and published a Work-in-Progress paper [Virtual Horse: an Anthropomorphic Notification Interface for Traffic Accident Reduction](docs/AutomotiveUI%20'21%20Adjunct/work-in-progress.md), you can click the link for details.

There is also a [supplementary document](docs/AutomotiveUI%20'21%20Poster/supplementary-information.md), containing some useful information we don't have enough space to mention in the paper/poster.
