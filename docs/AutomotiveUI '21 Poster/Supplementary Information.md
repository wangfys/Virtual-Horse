# Supplementary information of Virtual Horse

Here are some supplementary information that is not presented in the paper and the poster.

## 1. Why using a horse to show warnings?

According to our assumption that V2X technologies will be widely used, it is possible that a system can send traffic accident forecasts, especially from those moving vehicles/humans/animals hiding behind obstacles. 

We hope the accident forecast be fast and persuasive.
1. The forecast is fast so drivers have enough time to react.
2. The forecast is persuasive so drivers can trust it without hesitation. Why? Because the drivers can't see any evidence of a potential crash. People may doubt when there is no evidence. For example, it is sunny now and there is no cloud in the sky. The weather forecast says it will be rainy in 1 minute. It's very natural that people doubt whether the weather forecast is accurate.

There are several exisiting methods to show warning information:
1. Text warnings. Human drivers may be distracted.
2. Speech warnings. Human drivers may be distracted. And it's not fast enough.
3. Audio warnings like beeps. Usually, this kind of warning information is quite useful. It draws people's attention immediately. But it is not persuasive because it doesn't have enough amount of information. It doesn't shows the evidence.

Is there a way to make people trust a warning easily? Emotional behaviors!
+ If you see somebody is crying, you understand that something sad happens.
+ If you see somebody is laughing, you understand that something happy happens.
+ If you see somebody is screaming, you understand that something horrible happens.

And it's powerful that you may be infected by other's emotions. You may start laughing just because you see another person laughs. By using emotional behaviors, we can make human drivers feel there are potential dangers easily.

But that's not enough. There are lots of types of dangers. How to make drivers understand that there will be a traffic accident? We need something else to bring the information regarding traffic!

So we decide to use a horse's emotional behaviors as an interface.
1. It is well-known that lots of animals have a better sense of danger. For example, animals show strange behaviors before earthquakes.
2. It is well-known that horses are used for traffic purposes for centuries. So the warning is traffic-related.


## 2. How the interface actually looks like?

The poster only shows static images so here is a GIF as an example!
![Course1](Course1.gif)

1. The horse runs when the car is moving.
1. The horse stands up on its rear feet when there is potential danger.
1. The horse stands still when the car is stopped. 

## 3. What's the time margin of this interface?

In our pilot study, the virtual horse is designated to warn the driver about 2 seconds before a potential crash. This time margin can be changed and further discussed in different ways.

According to our assumption, V2X technologies can predict potential accidents by analyzing the future movement of all objects on the road. So the time margin is related to the precision of the accident forecast.

This setting can be different at different stage of the user study.
1. At an early stage, we can set it as a fixed time margin so we can compare it with other methods. It should not be too long so the participants need to pay full attention to the traffic situation so they can react as fast as possible.
2. Then we can set it as an unfixed time margin to find a comfortbale setting for human drivers in daily driving.
